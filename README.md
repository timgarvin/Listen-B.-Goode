Made by music fans for music fans, Listen B. Goode is a website that provides various [Tools](http://listenbgoode.000webhostapp.com/tools/ "Tools | Listen B. Goode") and [Resources](http://listenbgoode.000webhostapp.com/resources/ "Resources | Listen B. Goode") to make the online music experience easier and more convenient for music archivists, hobbyists, radio stations, DJs, music fans, and anyone in general who enjoys music. The name Listen B.

# Tools
* [Artwork Resizer](http://listenbgoode.000webhostapp.com/tools/artwork-resizer/ "Artwork Resizer | Listen B. Goode"): Artwork Resizer is a great tool for anyone who would like to find their preferred music release image size from Bandcamp or SoundCloud. The really cool thing also, is that all of the images are resized by the official site itself! Listen B. Goode does not actually resize the images itself, instead it simply points you to the official website address you're looking for to give you the preferred image size. This is especially great for those who archive digital music they buy, such as myself. When archiving digital music releases I bought, I often preferred to have a music release cover image with the largest image size possible. This is ideal for archiving music because images only still look good resized when they go from a larger sized image to a smaller sized image. There is always a possibility that you may end up with an image that is too small and would in turn have to be stretched to a larger size, which makes the image look pixelated. I often found it difficult to find the biggest possible image size I could find on websites like Bandcamp and SoundCloud. Therefore, I created the Artwork Resizer to resolve this issue for myself and others. No more clicking through endless pages wondering if the size you found is the largest possible! I also provide all other possible image sizes for both Bandcamp and SoundCloud for those who may have other goals.
* [SoundCloud Tracks Loader](http://listenbgoode.000webhostapp.com/tools/soundcloud-tracks-loader/ "SoundCloud Tracks Loader | Listen B. Goode"): The SoundCloud Tracks Loader is an awesome tool for loading tracks from SoundCloud profiles of your choosing. This is very helpful for SoundCloud profiles with tons of tracks, because there is one huge flaw in how SoundCloud built their website: they make your browser load a new player element for every track you load! The inevitable result for profiles with enough tracks is, unfortunately, that your browser will eventually crash (like mine did) and you will have no way of accessing the tracks at the bottom of the profile. Here's a good example profile of this: House This is why I created the SoundCloud Tracks Loader tool! It resolves that issue completely and allows music fans to access all of the tracks on a profile, including those tracks you couldn't get to when your browser crashed. Instead of making your browser load thousands of SoundCloud audio players, Listen B. Goode instead loads just one SoundCloud player for you and allows you to select a track you want to check out through a text-based playlist. This solves a huge problem and allows all us music fans out there to hear the tracks we're missing out on.
