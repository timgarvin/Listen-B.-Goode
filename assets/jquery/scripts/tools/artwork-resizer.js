Description: Artwork Resizer is a tool that allows music archivists and fans alike to load artwork in a preferred
size that may not otherwise be found when simply browsing SoundCloud or Bandcamp alone. This tool does not 
actually resize the image itself, but edits SoundCloud and Bandcamp image URLs in such a way that has SoundCloud 
and Bandcamp load the new sizes for us. This is an important feature of this tool because this keeps the newly 
loaded artwork size official for music archiving. This is especially useful for music archiving when loading 
larger image sizes that may not be found otherwise. Larger image sizes are recommended over smaller image sizes
for music release archiving, because an image will always look better reduced in size than stretched to a bigger
size (causes pixelation).*/
